How to Play

<p>
The beauty of tabletop games is that all you really need to get started is a group of friends, a few pair of dice, and an imagination.  
Much like <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">DnD</abbr>, Autumn Fall does not necessarily require all players to buy special merchandise.  As long as someone has 
a copy of the player's guide, monster manual, and dungeon master's guide then all players can share resources between one another.  If you are 
interested in role-playing games, then feel free to check out the D&D website at <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop/players-basic-rules">
DND Wizards of the Coast</a>.  This will provide a great reference for those seeking to understand basic rules of combat and interactions with the world.  
Autumn Fall borrows from many of these aspects, so reading up on the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset can ease the transition to tabletop gaming in general.
</p>

</div>

<h2 onclick="dropdown1()"><span>The Role of Dice Rolls</span></h2>

<div id="content1" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/dice.png" alt="Image of the Bloodletter">

</div>

<p>
At the heart of every turn of combat, every interaction with a merchant, and even one's ability to see through the deceit of others comes down to dice rolls.  
Even in video games, decisions of chance come down to hidden dice rolls, known as random number generators, that determine a player's success or failure.  For example, 
when people try to catch Pokemon in such games as Pokemon Go!, the game decides whether an attempt succeeds or fails based on factors that equate to bonuses or penalties 
to a dice roll.  For example, putting a Pokemon to sleep adds a certain bonus to the base success chance.  This could mean the difference between success or failure on a borderline 
roll.
</p>

<p>
Let's use a real example to aid in the demonstration.  A Goblin has a defense rating of 12.  You attack this Goblin with a standard weapon by using a d20--a dice that contains numbers up to 20 
as in the picture above--to attack with.  You roll an 11.  Since an 11 is less than his 12 defense, you would miss.  Now lets take in account that your character has a +2 bonus to attack taking into account 
the character's strength and proficiency with the chosen weapon.  Your roll becomes a 13 (11 + 2).  Since 13 is higher than the Goblin's defense, you hit the Goblin.  This battle of dice rolls takes on 
many aspects of the game.  For instance, haggling with a merchant would pit their merchantile skill roll against your own in determining your ability to beat down their prices.
</p>

<p>
There are many kind of dice such as the d8--eight-sided dice--that come into play in certain situations.  For simplicity's sake, the player needs only understand the basics of rolls are written.  The first number 
refers to the amount of dice while the second number refers to the number of sides a dice has.  For instance, if you hit the Goblin in the above example and your character does 2d6 damage with your weapon, you 
would roll a six-sided dice twice to determine damage.  8d3 would mean you would roll a three-sided dice eight times and so on.  A weapon's weighted dice determines its range of damage, thus choosing the right kind 
of weapon to suit your playstyle is important when picking a weapon.
</p>

</div>

<h2 onclick="dropdown2()"><span>Creating a Character</span></h2>

<div id="content2" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/archer.png" alt="Image of a player scout">

</div>

<p>
Choosing the right race and class is the most important choice in the creation of a character.  While each race can take any class that the player chooses, certain races are naturally suited for particular classes 
and their bonuses naturally lend themselves to certain paths.  For instance, a Dwarf possesses the natural strength and vitality that is well-suited for warrior classes such as the Bloodbarian; however, their naturally 
low agility could make them less effective rogues than other races.  In the world of Autumn Fall, every race will have nonplayer characters from all classes, but the attributes of each race are clearly shown in their societal 
structure from the weapons they carry to the tactics they employ.
</p>

<p>
After choosing a race, the player must choose a starting class and eventually their subclass that will determine their abilities and skills.  Base classes do not favor one attribute over another and will grant the player basic 
abilities that are attributed to a certain playstyle.  Bishops will provide support abilities and Bloodletters will provide curses to the player as they level up for example.
</p>

<p>
After the third level, players choose a subclass that 
determines their specialty within their chosen class.  These subclasses each favor certain attributes that are the basis for their abilities.  For example, the duration and strength of a Paladin's aura is based off their Charisma, thus 
a player that chooses a Paladin with low Charisma would find their abilities far weaker than a player that planned ahead.  For this reason, it is a good idea to have an idea of your desired playstyle prior to character creation.
</p>

</div>

<h2 onclick="dropdown4()"><span>Attributes</span></h2>

<div id="content4" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/stats.png" alt="Image of a player scout">

</div>

<p>
Each stat determines different capabilities of a character in certain aspects meant to culminate in their overall competence at tasks and skills.  
This is to create balance within the world.  A player's stats are determined by dice rolls prior to the campaign.  A player rolls 7d6, or 7 six-sided dice, 
and allocate these bonuses to their base 10 attributes while dropping the lowest role.  This would determine my various attributes that my character 
will have throughout the duration of the campaign.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Example</strong></br>
I roll a 2, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, and a 6.  I can drop the lowest roll (the 1) and arrange these bonuses in a manner of my choosing.  As a Rogue Assassin, I would build 
my character in this manner:
</li>

<li>
Strength.  Base 10 + 4 = 14.
</li>

<li>
Agility.  Base 10 + 6 = 16.
</li>

<li>
Vitality.  Base 10 + 5 = 15.
</li>

<li>
Intelligence.  Base 10 + 6 = 16.
</li>

<li>
Spirituality.  Base 10 + 2 = 12.
</li>

<li>
Charisma.  Base 10 + 3 = 13.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Below is a brief description of the various attributes and some of their functions within Autumn Fall.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Strength</strong></br>
Strength affects damage dealt by melee weapons and carrying capacity.  In addition, any feat requiring raw power, such as grappling or lifting, is also determined 
in part by strength bonuses of the particular character.  In a sense, Strength is simply raw power in every sense of the phrase.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Agility</strong></br>
Agility affects a character's natural dexterity and the ability to perform nimble feats such as rolls and dodges.  Depending on the armor, a positive Agiity modifier 
can provide bonuses to a defense rating as well.  If the weapon is referred to as a finesse weapon, such as daggers or kukris, then Agility bonuses can be used instead of Strength 
for attack rolls (not damage rolls).  A high agility score suits rogues and other classes who must remain stealthy and light on their feet.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Vitality</strong></br>
Vitality affects the player's hit point total as well as their ability to resist diseases and poisons.  While Vitality is especially important to front-line characters such as the 
Bloodbarian, all classes find this attribute useful and is typically favored after primary attributes have been assigned.  Vitality modifiers also affect the amount of healing a character 
receives from healing spells.  A hardy warrior will gain more hp than a frail magic user for instance.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Intelligence</strong></br>
Unlike in standard Dungeons and Dragons, Autumn Fall assimilates the Wisdom stat into the Intelligence stat as well.  Intelligence refers to the overall intellect of a character, their ability 
to strategize, their ability to see through illusions, and is often used as a governing stat for many magic users.  An intelligent character also possesses a greater understanding of the world 
and is more likely to know of the history of its people, places, and creatures.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Spirituality</strong></br>
Spirituality affects a player's ability to resist and conjure curses and paranormal abilities.  It also determines a player's understanding of alternate planes of existence and the creatures that 
exist within them.  Although there are many classes such as the Rogue that find little use for this stat, it is essential attribute for classes such as the Bishop due to their association with 
the Old Gods.  The Bishop's ability to understand the nature of the undead and other unnatural enemies is based off this attribute.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Charisma</strong></br>
Charisma affects the ability to deceive, and be deceived, as well as a character's natural leadership qualities.  In fact, all social skills tie into the Charisma attribute, thus making it an 
important noncombat stat to have.  Along with Vitality, Charisma also roughly determines a character's physical attractiveness.  For certain classes such as the Paladin, Charisma is in fact a 
relevant combat attribute as it determines the effects of their auras as these skills are used to inspire others.
</li>

</ul>

</div>

<h2 onclick="dropdown5()"><span>Skills and Bonuses</span></h2>

<div id="content5" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/sword.png" alt="Image of a player scout">

</div>

<p>
Now that a character has been assigned attributes, we can begin to understand bonuses and assign skills to the character.  More than just being a number, an attribute governs bonuses that are 
granted to all skills.  The base total for a stat is 10.  This confers neither a penalty nor a bonus to the character.  For every even number above or below 10, a +/- 1 is given to a skill related to 
an attribute.  This may sound complicated at first, but the below example provides a simple example of how a stat affects a skill check in Autumn Fall.
</p>

<p>
For example, if a Rogue is attempting to sneak up to an enemy, then they would make a sneak skill check.  Sneak is an agility skill, so the player would refer to their agility stat to determine any bonuses 
to the roll.  If the Rogue in the prior example had an Agility score of 16, then they would receive a +3 bonus to the skill check (6/2 = 3).  Conversely, a Dwarf warrior with an Agility stat of 8 would 
receive a -1 roll to the same check (-2/2 = -1).
</p>

<p>
Every skill has an associated attribute that is used prior to an ability check roll.  Attacks and spells should also be considered skills as they rely on associated attributes as well depending on the weapon 
and spell type.  The same rules apply to combat as well.  The Rogue in the above example would get the same +3 to their attack role from finesse weapons since they would use their Agility stat for the attack.  As we 
continue to add content to the game, a list of skills and their governing attributes will be made available.  
</p>

<p>
This is the basics of how to play Autumn Fall.  Again, since the game borrows many of the aspects of Dungeons and Dragons, visiting their website will allow players to grasp a more detailed explanation of many of the rules at their 
<a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop/players-basic-rules">website.</a>  Although some of these aspects will differ, it is a great reference for how many of the systems such as weapon and armor will function in the future.
