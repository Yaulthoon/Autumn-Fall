About the World of Autumn Fall
</h1>

<h2 onclick="dropdown3()"><span>History of Asther</span></h2>

<div id="content3" class="dropdownContent1">

<p>
More than a hundred years ago the world of Asther faced an untold calamity.  Due to reasons unknown, the sun disappeared from 
the sky.  There was no sign of impending doom or destruction, only darkness.  Many died due to the rot and decay of the land and 
everyone began to accept that these were the end of days.
</p>

<p>
According to legend, a powerful priest now known as the Almighty sacrificed his lifeforce into a sacred amulet that was used to create 
the Rahsin, or second sun.  Although it could not shine upon the entire world, this new entity gave the people hope as they began to rebuild 
their lives around the Rahsin.
</p>

<p>
Feeling that the Old Gods had forsaken them, many people began worshipping the Almighty as a symbol of man's triumph over nature.  Decades began to 
pass as the inhabitants of Asther began to rebuild.  Over time, many began to understand the lay of the land and began settling around the prized 
"Ring of Autumn" that exuded the ideal balance of light and warmth.  A natural concentration of wealth began to immerge as a result with the wealthiest 
individuals settling within the Ring.  The world would appear to be returning to a period of peace and prosperity.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Even as time passed and the world seemed to be moving forward, it appears that not all would is well.  It would seem as if the very world itself was starting to reject 
the new order.  Creatures from outside the Autumn lands are evolving at an unheard of rate.  Many living towards the far reaches of the Autumn lands are developing a strange 
sickness known as Bloodrot that cannot be cured.  Many seek refuge within the Ring, but there is limited space to accommodate them.  
</p>

<p>
Despite the apparent danger, there are many that would deny that anything is wrong with the world.  Wealthy merchant associations continue to send bands of scouts into the lands surrounding Autumn to 
find riches of old and establish new trading posts.  Many families must live on the outside to gather the raw materials needed to supply those who live within the Ring of Autumn.  
The majority of Asther's people continue to praise the Almighty and his creation, the Rahsin, regardless of the suffering of others.  The world would surely have perished without the sun, 
so they must be willing to accept certain sacrifices and hardships so that the world can continue on.
</p>

<p>
A select few reject the legends and the notion that there are no solutions to these problems.  Many adventurers set out to reach the base of Rahsin in order to determine 
the truth of what happened there.  Others are convinced that there are still other civilizations beyond the Dusk lands and travel in search of them.  Will you fight for the sake of the survival 
of mankind or will you attempt to uncover the truth behind the events of Autumn Fall?  The choice is yours.
