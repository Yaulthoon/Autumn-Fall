<h2 onclick="dropdown3()"><span>Dwarf</span></h2>

<div id="content3" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/dwarf.png" alt="Image of the Dwarf"></div>

<p>
Dwarves are the lords of the underground cities that serve as some of the few settlements outside of Autumn.  Because of this, 
Dwarves enjoy considerable trading clout as many materials harvested above ground often pass through these cities in order to pass
safely back to Autumn.  Although Dwarves enjoy filling their coffers with extra gold, many do not like the frequency in which 
non-Dwarves pass through their lands as they are used to living in relative isolation prior to the calamity brought 
about by the appearance of the artificial sun.
</p>

<p>
Due to their rigorous work ethic, Dwarves gain bonuses to their strength and vitality.  At the same time, their bulky bodies 
makes it difficult for Dwarves to move quickly resulting in a penalty to their agility stat.  Dwarves tend to favor brawn over 
brains, but many are shrewd traders that value the art of persuasion.  Unlike other small races such as Halflings, Dwarves have 
the carrying capacity of medium-sized humanoids such as Elves and Humans due to their natural strength.
</p>

<h2 onclick="dropdown1()"><span>Human</span></h2>

<div id="content1" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/human.png" alt="Image of the Human">

</div>

<p>
Humans may not possess the lifespans of many of the other races, but they are the most ingenuous of all the races.  
Humans are the most eager to explore outside of Autumn and often send parties of adventurers in search of hospitable 
lands.  For better or worse, as the youngest of the races, Humans generally get along with everyone else and often act 
as intermediaries settling dispute among the various other races.
</p>

<p>
Due to the variety of their race, Humans often lack any true distinction.  Because Humans are social creatures by nature, 
they often enjoy forming parties with others and prefer to use group tactics over individual skill.  While some view their 
lack of distinction as a hinderance, they are well-suited to jobs that require a well-rounded, resourceful individual.  Their 
ability to adjust their stats is unique among the races.  With their naturally high charisma, Humans make exceptional leaders 
and do well in subclasses such as the Paladin that utilize the Charisma stat for their aura abilities.

<h2 onclick="dropdown2()"><span>Snow Elf</span></h2>

<div id="content2" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/snowelf.png" alt="Image of the Snow Elf"></div>

<p>
Natives of the Dusk lands, Snow Elves live in seclusion in the harsh winter environment outside of all warmth.  Snow Elves get their name from their 
snow-white complexion and are a rare sight in Autumn.  In order to survive, Snow Elves spend much of their lives honing their magic in 
order to provide warmth, light, and other resources normally unavailable in the Dusk lands.  When seen in normal society, these Elves usually 
serve as guides for adventuring Human parties in the Dusk lands or traders selling goods unique to the Dusk lands.
</p>

<p>
Due to the harshness of their environment, Snow Elves are frail by nature; however, their magic prowess is unrivaled amongst all races.  They are 
naturally suited for magic classes and can conjure spirit weapons to compensate for their low strength.  Although most races experience an adverse 
reaction to the Autumn sun's light if overexposed, the effects are especially prevalent in Snow Elves.  They must exercise great caution as overexposure 
often results in developing the symptoms of Bloodlet.
