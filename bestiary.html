<h2 onclick="dropdown3()"><span>Cynx</span></h2>

<div id="content3" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/autumnJaguar.png" alt="Image of the Cynx"></div>

<p>
Known by its more common name, the Autumn Jaguar, the Cynx ambushes prey that make their way through the surrounding forests 
that exist around the outskirts of Autumn.  Like many creatures native to the Dawn lands, the Cynx's coat is covered in malignant 
sun spots that provide an even greater degree of natural camouflage.  An experienced adventurer can tell the age and strength of a cynx 
by the amount of discoloration in their fur.
</p>

<p>
The Cynx utilizes its stealth and powerful claws to attack unsuspecting prey.  While dangerous to a lone adventurer, most Cynx are skittish 
when faced with multiple foes, so they are rarely a danger to a group.  When cornered, or facing starvation, they have been known to attack groups 
often targeting the most imposing figure first in an effort to gain the upper hand.  True to its name, Cynx's mainly reside around the outskirts of major cities 
and are a rare sight in the deeper reaches of the Dawn lands and prefer to hunt where smaller, natural creatures reside such as rabbits or deer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Natural Abilities</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>

</li>

<li>

</ol>

<h2 onclick="dropdown1()"><span>Goblin</span></h2>

<div id="content1" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/goblin.png" alt="Image of the Goblin">

</div>

<p>
Goblins reside in the mountains throughout the inhabitable reaches of the world.  Though they are capable of forming 
small bands and tribes, Goblins value power more than the other sentient races and often betray one another in order to 
further their own ambitions.  Because of this, Goblins face difficulties forming a true society and usually only band together 
to fend off a common threat to their mountain strongholds.  Goblins especially hate Dwarves and reject the rights that the Dwarves 
claim to the mining rights of the mountain territories.
</p>

<p>
Because of the terrain, Goblins primarily make use of spears and crossbows in combat.  Larger tribes also possess siege weaponry such 
as ballistas for both assaulting other Goblin fortresses.  Despite their treachery, Goblins can work together and use basic tactics.  If they 
perceive a numbers advantage, they attack brazenly; however, they are equally capable of guerrilla tactics to take down more powerful foes.  The 
opportunistic qualities of the Goblins make them a notable threat in the mountainous territories of the realm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Natural Abilities</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Gains a +1 flank bonus to hit if another Goblin targets the same enemy in the same turn.
</li>

<li>
Proficiency in spears, crossbows, and Goblin siege weaponry.
</li>

<li>
Does not incur a movement penalty in difficult terrain caused in mountain territories.
</li>

<h2 onclick="dropdown2()"><span>Jaeger</span></h2>

<div id="content2" class="dropdownContent1">

<div class="subheading"><img src="pictures/jaeger.png" alt="Image of the Jaeger"></div>

<p>
Also known as the Ghost Wolf, Jaegers are found deep within the Dusk lands.  Little is known 
of their origin and capabilities.  It is said that if one is bitten by a Jaeger, then they 
will become one within a period of three days if left untreated by a purification spell of a Bishop.  
Because very few people have seen a true Jaeger, reports of their appearance vary greatly which has called 
their existence into question.  Regardless of inconsistencies, all reports agree they are a creature to be avoided at all costs.
</p>

<p>
Because they appear as wolves, most people believe they hunt in packs.  Aside from their poisonous bite, Jaegers
can attack with their claws and are said to possess a hallucinogenic gaze.  The gaze distorts reality giving them 
their appearance an ominous shadow that can distort the aim of enemies.  Legends of the Jaegers allude to the existence 
of a den mother referred to as the Okami.  It is said to rule the Dusk lands and that any adventurer capable of defeating her 
would gain her power and become the new ruler of her realm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Natural Abilities</strong>
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Hypnotic gaze causes disadvantage to-hit for one chosen enemy per turn as a free action.
</li>

<li>
Venomous bite.  A failed save causes the enemy to contract the disease known as Lupin's decay.
</li>

<li>
Can multi-attack with both its bite and claw attacks in a single turn.
</li>
